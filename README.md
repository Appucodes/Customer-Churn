# Customer Churn Prediction

## Introduction
This project investigates the factors influencing customer attrition in a telecommunications company. The aim is to develop predictive models using techniques like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest to retain customers. The report explores data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and modeling techniques to predict and identify potential churners.

## Data Cleaning
The dataset, containing information for 7043 customers with 21 features, underwent quality checks, missing value handling, and outlier detection (details in Appendix A).

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Insights from EDA revealed associations between churn and variables like partner, internet service, tech support, and contract type (details in Appendix B).

## Modeling
### Logistic Regression
An initial logistic regression model provided insights into important features like tenure, contract type, and payment method, aiding in predicting churn.

### Decision Tree
Decision tree analysis showed promise, highlighting significant features impacting churn such as monthly charges, tenure, and contract duration.

### Random Forest
The random forest model helped in refining churn prediction, considering various features' impact on customer attrition.

## Conclusion
Optimized logistic regression emerged as the most accurate model, emphasizing the significance of contract duration, pricing strategies, and service quality in customer retention. Recommendations include improving service quality, focusing on longer-term contracts, and monitoring pricing strategies.
